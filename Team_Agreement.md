# Group Project: Team Agreement

The first step in project planning is establishing a Team Agreement. This will be used as the guideline for how your team will collaborate during project week.
Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn’t be a problem. It’s important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.

## Planning
Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team.
Use this time to review the Team Agreement requirements below, and establish consensus on how to handle each requirement.

## Deliverable
Start a public-facing GitHub markdown file, and include the following components in your team agreement submission.

## Cooperation Plan
Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

Describe at least:

- What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
    - David Prutch - Communication, Organization, Attention to detail
    - Gerald Reitmeyer - Communication, attention to detail
    - Robert Gillespie- Communication, Consistency, Hard worker
    - David Siebert - Communication, Organization, willing to accept challenges. 
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
    - David Prutch - Promote open communication with the team, help organize project tasks into easier goals. 
    - Robert Gillespie- Performing hard work on my portion of the presentation while communicating consistently with my team members. 
    - David Siebert - Open to accept any position needed in my team. Open door of communication, Checking in on individuals projects, deadlines needs. Excellent at presentation structures and theme creation. 
    - Gerald Reitmeyer - talk about any idea or any struggles on my own tasks, asking for help when needed,
- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
    - David Prutch - Business Acumen Competency
    - Gerald Reitmeyer - Planning and Estimating, Technical skills, Agile/Agility
    - Robert Gillespie- Problem solving, Technical skills
    - David Siebert - Technical skillset, overcoming imposter syndrome. 
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
    - Break up tasks individually or in subgroups as necessary and discuss each portion of the project as a team to provide comprehensive team understanding.
    - Review and approve all SOPs as a team for final approval.
- NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

## Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:
- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
    - Discuss the issue as a group to come to a team resolution.
    - Escalate to a third party if resolution can not be achieved.
    - What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
    - Have a team discussion with the individual and help them understand they need to let others share in the responsibility. Have them pair with others to provide insight and guidance.
- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
    - Work to our strengths and help give each other a better understanding of the subject matter.
    - Work as a team or in pairs to guide each other to better understanding.
- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
    - Respectively communicate what the issue is and a plan of action behind how that person can contribute up to standard.
- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
    - If there is an issue with a resolution for an individual that is not being followed. The individual was told multiple times to change and nothing followed. The best next step is to speak with the instructor to come up with a solution. 

## Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:
- What hours will you be available to communicate?
    - Normal class hours 9am-6pm PST (overtime if needed)
    - Meet in Remo at 9:00 am PST daily for standup
- What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
    - Slack
    - Remo
- How often will you take breaks?
    - Every hour take a 10 minute break
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
    - Take a look at the project management tool and see what tasks need to be done
    - Reassess our deadlines
    - Check project scope
    - Coordinate efforts to solve issues. 
- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
    - Slack
- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
    - Take turns speaking/inputting
- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
    - No judgment
    - Listen to and consider feedback/suggestions
    - Respectfully asking for clarifying questions if confused 

## Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.
- NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

Describe at least:
- How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
    - The group will go over what tasks need to be done, everyone will pick the assignments they want to do, and the tasks will be put in the To Do list in GitHub project tool
- What project management tool will be used?
    - GitHub project management tool

## Presentation Deck
- Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy with all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.
- Link to the shared doc in your project plan.

## Schedule your practice session
- Work with your instructor to pre-schedule a date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.
- Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:
- Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
- When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
- Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”

## Git Process
Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

Describe at least:
- What components of your project will live on GitHub?
    - All documents, scripts, presentation materials, and any other project materials required to complete this project.
- How will you share the repository with your teammates?
    - It will be an organization where everyone has editing access.
- What is your Git flow?
- Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
    - This will not be necessary as this is not a code project.
    - We will review all documentation as a team for final review but everyone can push their documents to the repo.
- How many people must review a PR?
- Who merges PRs?
- How often will you merge?
- How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
