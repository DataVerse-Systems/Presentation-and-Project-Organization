# Prepare for Projects
For this project, you will be summarizing all of the concepts you’ve learned and applied in labs up to this point of the course. Your instructional team will provide you with further specification regarding constraints and expectations for course-specific requirements.

At this point, you should have an idea as to what’s possible to create given what your course has covered so far and will cover before the start of the project. Use that knowledge to generate some ideas and discussion!

## Project Requirements
Your instructor will provide the detailed requirements for your project, and team tasks.

## Group Project: Pitch Ideas
It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project. You’ve been given groups, so the first step for group projects is to pitch ideas.
Tasks

As a group, arrange a 30-60 minute time when you can all be in the same place. Lab time is ideal for this.

There will be two phases for this: brainstorm ideas, and pitching projects.

## Brainstorming Ideas
Grab a whiteboard and brainstorm ideas. During this phase, there is no comment or criticism of ideas. Ideas should be given in the form of titles or very short phrases. If an explanation is needed, save it for the pitch round.

## Pitching a Project
Once a critical mass of ideas has been written down, the person who offered the idea will give a pitch. Each pitch may be no longer than 2 to 3 minutes. The purpose of a pitch is to sell the idea to your group mates. During this phase, questions may be asked, but the discussion should be limited. Keep it short and to the point.

At the end of the pitch, you should have formed a short list of favorites.
Create your Pitch

Once your team has decided on 1 or 2 favorites, prepare your pitches for submission.

## Each pitch should contain the following information:
- Name of Project
    - DataVerse Systems
- Summary of idea.
    - Join a private network of a newly acquired startup to company VPN with AD on AWS.
    - Make it repeatable for future acquisitions.
- What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)
    - Make onboarding a new company acquisition quicker, easier and consistent with current company standards.
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.
    - What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?
    - Create a VPC on AWS utilizing a Windows Server with AD.
    - Connect via VPN to a private network with a pfSense router and Windows 10 machines.
    - pfSense will have a captive portal which points to AD for authentication.
    - Automation scripts.
